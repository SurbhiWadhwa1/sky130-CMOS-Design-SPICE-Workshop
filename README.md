**Brief description of the course**
<br>
VLSI System Design organized a ten day workshop on CMOS circuit design and SPICE simulation using SKY130 technology.The workshop offered an in-depth knowledge of the MOSFET fundamentals, CMOS inverter behaviour, switching thresholds, noise margins, dynamic simulations and how the power supply and device variations affect the circuit, all reinforced through hands-on CMOS/SPICE exercises, including circuit simulation, waveform analysis and real device exploration.
<br>
This workshop was structured into five sections:
<br>1) NMOS Fundamentals: Basics of drain current (Id), drain-to-source voltage (Vds) and their characteristic plot
<br>2) Velocity Saturation and Basics of CMOS Inverter voltage tranfer characteristics and plot between Id and Vgs and plot to determine Vt
<br>
3) Switching threshold and dynamic simulations: Analyzing PMOS/NMOS W/L ratios and threshold voltage (Vm) through practical simulations
<br>
4) Evaluating CMOS Noise margins and inverter robustness
<br>
5) Lastly, studying the impact of power supply and device variations on circuit and evaluating their robustnes. We studied the advantages and disadvantages of using small power supply and also the impact of device variation on single inverter and and inverter chain were discussed.
<br>Each section included practical lab exercises using SPICE- which enables us to apply theory to simulate circuits, study the waveforms and observe real device behaviour practically.
