VLSI System Design organized a ten day workshop on CMOS circuit design and SPICE simulation using SKY130 technology. It provided deep understanding of the MOSFET fundamentals, inverter behaviour, switching thresholds, noise margins, dynamic simulations, power/device variations, with hands-on CMOS/SPICE-simulate circuits, study waveforms-real device
